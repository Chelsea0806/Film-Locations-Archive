<p>Westminster underground station is one of the main film locations for "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)">[2]</a>. Harry Potter and Mr. Weasley passed through Westminster underground station when they were on their way to the Ministry of Magic for interrogation. Mr. Weasley was excited to see the "Muggle" turnstile gate in the station, although he met problems using his ticket at the turnstile gate.</p>

<p>The station is located next to London's famous attractions such as the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Downing Street and Westminster Abbey.</p>
