<p class="dropCap">The ancient cloister of Durham Cathedral became the filming location of Hogwarts in the 2001 "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Cathedral">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The first two movies Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)">[2]</a> and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets">[3]</a> were shot at Durham Cathedral.Against the snowy background, the cloister became a snow-covered quadrilateral, which is also the courtyard of Durham Cathedral. Harry magically released the owl Hedwig from his hands. This is Harry Potter's first year flying in the snow. The place where Hedwig was passed, and the place where Ron spit slugs in the secret room. The following year, Harry and his friends returned to Darlemâ€™s unesco World Heritage Site to shoot the sequel to the Chamber of Secrets. In the film "The Chamber of Secrets" Mrs. McGonagall taught the Hogwarts students to turn animals into goblets. Taken in the cathedral branch hall.</p>

<p>In the gentle hilly area of northeastern England, on a brown cliff, sits a magnificent cathedral. This is one of the ten cathedrals in the UK and the very famous Durham Cathedral. Durham Cathedral was built in 1093 and was only completed in 1130. It is the first church in the UK to be completely covered with stone. Although its design is relatively simple, the volume of the nave is amazing. Among the churches built by the Normans in England in the early days, Durham Cathedral is the most spectacular. Despite its size, it is still one of the best designed and planned churches so far.</p>
