<p class="dropCap">Diagon Alley is the most prosperous commercial street in the British magical world in the famous magical novel series "Harry Potter" by J.K Rowling <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Many first-line brand stores in the magical world have "flagship stores" here. It is a cobblestone wizarding alley, hidden in a small patio behind the Leaky Cauldron <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shambles">[2]</a>, which is invisible to the Muggles in London, England. It can be accessed by hitting a specific wall tile next to the trash can with a magic wand.</p>

<p>I have to mention here that The Shambles is a medieval shopping street in York, but it is also considered to be one of the inspiration sources for Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter movies <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shambles">[3]</a>. Therefore, it is often referred to as Harry Potter Street in York.</p>

<p>Although it is not certain whether Rowling was inspired by this street, it is easy to see the similarities between this road in York and the fictional magic alleys we see in the Harry Potter movies.</p>

<p>The Shambles was voted the most beautiful street in the UK in the Google Street View Awards! It is also a place worth visiting for taking pictures.</p>
