<p class="dropCap">In the sixth part of the "Harry Potter" film series, the Death Eaters invaded the Muggle world, and the majestic bridge that they attacked was the Millennium Bridge <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Bridge,_London">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The destroyed moments in the movie are post-production special effects, but the Millennium Bridge in the scene is truly real. The Millennium Bridge was built in the United Kingdom to welcome the millennium, spanning the Thames domineeringly, connecting the Tate Modern and St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral <a href="http://online-travel-guru.blogspot.com/2009/">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The Millennium Bridge in London is about 325 meters long and the design concept is "Blade of light". The structure of the London Millennium Bridge is bright, with steel cables connecting various structural components to support the bridge body, and the steel cables are not directly connected to the bridge body. This unique suspension bridge design comes from the handwriting of British architect Norman Foster <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Foster,_Baron_Foster_of_Thames_Bank">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Overlooking the upper floors of the Tate Modern, you can have a panoramic view of the Millennium Bridge. Here are some amazing special effects in the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince movie <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince">[4]</a>!</p>
